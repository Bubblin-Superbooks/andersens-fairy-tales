But we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run to and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a wife for our little snail!”</p><p>“I know one, sure enough—the most charming one!” said one of the ants. “But I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!”</p><p>“That is nothing!” said the old folks. “Has she a house?”</p><p>“She has a palace!” said the ant. “The finest ant's palace, with seven hundred passages!”</p><p>“I thank you!” said Mother Snail. “Our son shall not go into an ant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the commission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and sunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without.”</p></div> </div>
