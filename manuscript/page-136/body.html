So then the Fir Tree told the whole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even; but they said the stories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they, too, now began to think them not so very amusing either.</p><p>“Do you know only one story?” asked the Rats.</p><p>“Only that one,” answered the Tree. “I heard it on my happiest evening; but I did not then know how happy I was.”</p><p>“It is a very stupid story! Don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles? Can't you tell any larder stories?”</p><p>“No,” said the Tree.</p><p>“Then good-bye,” said the Rats; and they went home.</p></div> </div>
