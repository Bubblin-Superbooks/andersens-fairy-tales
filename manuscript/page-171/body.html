The Prince and Princess</p><p>Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her, a large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking at Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, “Caw! Caw!” Good day! Good day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the little girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word “alone” Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed by it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not seen Kay.</p><p>The Raven nodded very gravely, and said, “It may be—it may be!”</p><p>“What, do you really think so?” cried the little girl; and she nearly squeezed the Raven to death, so much did she kiss him.</p></div> </div>
