A maid of seven years old gave me a kiss,
 I at that time was rich in poesy
 And tales of old, though poor as poor could be;
 But all she asked for was this poesy.</code></pre>
<p>   Then was I rich, but not in gold, poor me!
   As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.</p></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code>  “Oh, were I rich! Oft asked I for this boon.
The child grew up to womanhood full soon.
 She is so pretty, clever, and so kind</code></pre>
<p>   Oh, did she know what's hidden in my mind—
     A tale of old. Would she to me were kind!
   But I'm condemned to silence! oh, poor me!
   As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
